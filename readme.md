# Rust Permutations
Permutations is a rust library for manipulating and applying permutations.

    //! A module for representing permutations, applying them to slices and indices,
    //! and computing them from sort orders.
    //!
    //! Some practical uses of this module are:
    //!  * Calculate a sort, and apply it later.
    //!  * Calculate a sort on one vector, and apply it to multiple other vectors.
    //!  * Calculate the new index of an element before sorting.
    //!  * Remember the prior index of an element after sorting.
    //!  * Undo a sort.
    //!  * Compare the orderings of elements.
